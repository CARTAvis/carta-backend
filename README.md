# CARTA Image Viewer (Server)
Server for simple web-based interface for viewing images stored on a server in CASA, FITS, HDF5 (using the IDIA custom schema), and MIRIAD format. Unlike the conventional approach of rendering an image on the server and sending a rendered image to the client, the server sends a compressed subset of the data, and the client renders the image efficiently on the GPU using WebGL and GLSL shaders. While the data is compressed using the lossy ZFP algorithm, the compression artefacts are generally much less noticable than those cropping up from full-colour JPEG compression. While data sizes depend on compression quality used, sizes are [comparable](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lp1687TL0bYmbM3jGyjuPd9dYZnrAYGnLIQXWVpnmS0/edit?usp=sharing) with sizes of compressed JPEG images with a 95% quality setting, depending on the colour map used to generate the JPEG image. PNG compression is generally a factor of 2 larger than the ZFP compressed data.

## External dependencies
The server build depends on the following libraries: 
* [casacore](https://github.com/casacore/casacore) for CASA image libraries. Build and install from git repo.  casacore requires the HDF5 library (see below) for HDF5 images, numpy, and sofa, as well as casa data (https://open-bitbucket.nrao.edu/scm/casa/casa-data.git).
* [zfp](https://github.com/LLNL/zfp) for data compression. The same library is used on the client, after being compiled to WebAssembly. Build and install from git repo. For best performance, build with AVX extensions. 
* [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) for python-style (and safe printf-style) string formatting and printing. Debian package `libfmt3-dev`. 
* [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) for client-side communication using specific message formats. Debian package `libprotobuf-dev` (> 3.0 required. Can use [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~maarten-fonville/+archive/ubuntu/protobuf) for earlier versions of Ubuntu) 
* [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) C++ library for HDF5 support. Debian packages `libhdf5-dev` and `libhdf5-cpp-100`. By default, the serial version of the HDF5 library is targeted.
* [ÂµWS](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) for socket communication with client. Build and install from git repo.
* boost [filesystem](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/filesystem), [uuid](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/uuid) and [program_options](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/program_options) modules (All easily installed through `apt`)
* Threading Building Blocks [tbb](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/download) for task parallelization.

Use cmake to build. Currently, the server looks for image files in the `$HOME/Images` directory.
